# PLPBasicGitAssignment

In this assignment, I exercised on how to use Git and GitHub to add, commit and push changes to my repository.

The steps that I took where:


Initialize the repository on my local machine.

Create a text file,which I named hello.

Updated the text file with the following text: "Hello, Git", then saved it.

Added the changes to the staging area, using the git add hello.txt.

Commited the changes made and added a message for the changes that i made using the following command: git commit -m "Add text file with greeting".

Finally, I pushed the changes to the repository on GitHub, using the following command: git push -u origin main.

The last thing I did was verify that the changes were made and are reflecting on my repository on GitHub.
